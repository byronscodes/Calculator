# Calculator App

This calculator web application was made on VS Code with programming languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows a user to do basic math operations on numbers within a 10-digit display.

This is my first public application or project that I've made within Github and I made this calculator to further utilize my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Although basic, it is an introduction to UI/UX skills and JavaScript functions for further application in the future.

The calculator catches errors when trying to use multiple operations or decimals within a single calculation.
